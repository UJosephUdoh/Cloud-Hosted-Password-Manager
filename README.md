# Cloud-Hosted-Password-Manager
This was the installation and configuration of a cloud-hosted password manager through an AWS EC2 Instance.

## Objective
This project allowed me to visualize and gain experience in what it is like to setup and configure a password manager through an AWS EC2 instance. Through the use of key generation in Kali, I was able to generate a specific key pair and attach that to the EC2 instance to ensure security. I was also able to configure an SSL configuration to ensure that the passwords stored are not sent over the network in plaintext. Great experience!

### Skills Learned

- Gained an understanding of AWS practices and setting up an EC2 Instance
- Experience in acquiring a domain to host said instance and employ SSL setup to ensure encryption for data in transit
- Gained experience in configuring and managing workloads hosted in AWS cloud environments and ensuring adherence to cybersecurity best practices.
- Learned how Key Pair generation works through Hands-On experience in Kali Linux Terminal.


### Tools Used

- Virtualization System (VMWare Fusion Pro) for hosting Kali Linux.
- AWS for hosting and running the Password Manager EC2 Instance.
- Domain acquisition to allow for SSL communications over the network through HTTPS configuration.

## Steps
1. Set up the EC2 Instance through AWS's guided walkthrough ensuring proper key generation.
